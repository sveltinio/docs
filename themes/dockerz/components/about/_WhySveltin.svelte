			Well, Sveltin started as a personal side project that I now want to make public
			available.

			I'm a huge fan of <ExternalLink

				url="https://gohugo.io"
				class="text-skin-link-hover hover:text-skin-link-hover dark:text-skin-link-dark dark:hover:text-skin-link-dark-hover"

			> as static site generator. I used Hugo a lot for both internal (documentation) and public
			facing websites. It helped me setting up all I needed to be focused on the contents and the
			design. I love how the project is structured and how things are managed.

			Taking notes in markdown on almost everything or meeting I attend is my habit, as well
			as have those notes available to me in a good way. That is one of the reasons I run
			several internal websites.

		<p class="text-base font-light text-skin-body dark:text-skin-body-dark sm:text-lg">
			I am quite sure teams out there building the _next_ static site generator are doing
			super stuff, using all the skills and batteries they have to be stunned.

			Part of my DNA is to constantly look for new things to learn in different areas, I
			cannot live without it. Some time ago have started reading and documenting on Svelte
			even if I never approached it for a real use case. Infact, latest website I built for a
			friend of mine was powered by Hugo.

		<p class="text-base font-light text-skin-body dark:text-skin-body-dark sm:text-lg">
			I see Svelte growing in popularity and adaptions, simply because it does things in a
			cool way compared to others (I am referring to the way the DOM is managed, the build
			first approach, ...just to mention a couple). The near to come stable v.1.0 of <ExternalLink
				name="sveltekit"
				url="https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#introduction-what-is-sveltekit"
				class="text-skin-link-hover hover:text-skin-link-hover dark:text-skin-link-dark dark:hover:text-skin-link-dark-hover"
			>
				SvelteKit
			</ExternalLink>
			will help the Svelte adoption more, I am almost sure.
